## Work Experience
### **Software DevOps Engineer @ Birlasoft** (_Sept 2021 - Sept 2022_)  
- Led deployment and maintenance of software and database production servers for Synchrony Bank.  
- Ensured high system availability and reliability.  

## Projects  
### Computational Nanophotonics  
(_Dec 2023 - Present_)  
- Designed and optimized dielectric structures to improve photon collection efficiency by 30% for quantum-optical interfaces.
- Single photon emitters embedded inside waveguides have in-plane propogation. However to study the quality of a single photon source, we need to study quantum emissions of the source.
- We do it by coupling emitted photons to external fiber optics. We use a computationally designed (invers edesigned) coupler to achieve maximum coupling efficiency between the waveguide and optical fiber.

- Working toward integrating non-linear photonics and squeezed light generation for on-chip continuous-variable quantum computing.

### Muon Rate Variations During Extreme Solar Events  
(_April 2024 - June 2024_)  
- Built a muon detector and proposed an analytical framework to correlate muon data with extreme solar activities.  
- Found a 4% increase in muon rates corresponding to high proton flux events.

### Fault-Tolerant Universal Quantum Computation with Magic State Distillation  
(_Sept 2023 - Dec 2023_)  
- Analyzed fault-tolerant quantum computation using Clifford gates and magic state injection for T-gates.  
- Implemented error correction techniques, including quantum stabilizer codes and logical qubit encoding, to mitigate decoherence.
