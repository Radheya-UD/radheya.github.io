## Projects  
### Computational Nanophotonics  
(_Dec 2023 - Present_)  
- Designed and optimized dielectric structures to improve photon collection efficiency by 30% for quantum-optical interfaces.
- Single-photon emitters embedded inside waveguides primarily exhibit in-plane propagation of emitted photons. However, characterizing the quality of these sources requires studying their quantum optical properties, such as purity, indistinguishability, and coherence. To achieve this, the emitted photons must be efficiently extracted and coupled into external fiber optics for further analysis. We utilize computationally designed (inverse-designed) photonic couplers to maximize the coupling efficiency between the waveguide mode and the optical fiber mode. By leveraging adjoint-based optimization techniques, these couplers are tailored to minimize modal mismatch and propagation losses, ensuring high-fidelity photon transfer for downstream quantum measurements.

### Muon Rate Variations During Extreme Solar Events  
(_April 2024 - June 2024_)  
- Built a muon detector and proposed an analytical framework to correlate muon data with extreme solar activities.  
- Found a 4% increase in muon rates corresponding to high proton flux events.
